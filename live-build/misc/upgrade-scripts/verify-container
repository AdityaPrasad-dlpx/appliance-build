	#   the containers root filesystem. Normally, with PrivateUsers
	#   set to "yes", the container's root filesystem would be
	#   chowned to match the UID mapping used by the container.
	#
	# * Private: We set networking to "private" so that the
	#   container can use ports without conflicting with ports that
	#   are already in used by the host.
	#
	# * Bind=/dev/zfs: We set this so that zfs/zpool/libzpool/etc.
	#   is usable from within the container.
