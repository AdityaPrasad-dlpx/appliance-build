# For convenience, allow passwordless sudo for all ldap users on internal
# development appliances. Delphix ldap users are in a group with gid 10 because
# on Illumos gid 10 is assigned to the group staff. On Linux, gid 10 is assigned
# to the group uucp, so a side effect of this entry is that passwordless sudo is
# allowed for uucp. We can fix this eventually if we create a new ldap group
# with a unique gid and add all users to that group in addition to the group
# staff.
