# Until we have Delphix specific ZFS packages to install in the
# appliance, we have to clone and compile the ZFS on Linux repositories
# from source and install the resultant build artifacts. Thus, we use
# this dependent role to initialize the system with the necessary source
# code, and build dependencies. Later, we'll do the build and install.

dependencies:
