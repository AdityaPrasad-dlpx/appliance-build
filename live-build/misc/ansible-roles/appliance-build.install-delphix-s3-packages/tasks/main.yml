# We need to download the packages from S3 on the local system running
# the playbook, because the awscli tools may not be available on the
# remote system. Once the S3 directory/prefix containing the packages is
# downloaded, we safely copy them to the remote system, and proceed with
# the installation.
#
# Further, the expectation is for the S3 prefix to contain a directory
# containing one or more .deb files, as well as a SHA256SUMS file that
# can be used to verify the contents of the .deb files after the entire
# S3 prefix is downloaded.
